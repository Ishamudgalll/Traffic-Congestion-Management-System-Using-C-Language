# Traffic-Congestion-Management-System-Using-C-Language
My project Basically focus on Managing the traffic Congestion.             This problem   can be tackled by adopting traffic monitoring system based on density of vehicles.   This uses vehicles density as its tool for measuring the rush on the road. Based upon the calculated density of vehicles the traffic light are being controlled to manage the traffic. 

It is an intelligent traffic controlling system. 

Our present methodology adopted for traffic controlling is based upon the fix timing.

Each side has to wait for the fix time and they are allowed to cross the road for the limited fix time. 

This is feasible during normal traffic but fails during heavy rush.
 This waste the time of commuters as well as increases rush many folds.
